' Removing Internal XL passwords
' 
' Note: For a discussion of File or VBA Project password protection, see here.
' 
' Internal XL passwords are about as useful for security as tissue paper. The
' reason is that the passwords you enter (i.e., with Tools/Protect/Protect
' Worksheet or /Protect Workbook) are not used directly in protection. Instead
' they are hashed (mathematically transformed) into a much less secure code.
' Effectively, any password of any length is transformed into a string of 12
' characters, the first 11 of which have one of only two possible values. The
' remaining character can have up to 95 possible values, leading to only
' 
'     2^11 * 95  = 194,560 potential passwords. This may seem like a lot, but it
'     only takes a few seconds for a modern computer to try them all. As a
'     comparison, a 4-character password containing just the 26 lower case
'     alphabet characters has 456,976 combinations, and a 3-character password
'     consisting of lower case, upper case and the digits 0-9 will have 238,328
'     combinations.
' 
' Again, it doesn't matter what your original password is, one of those 194K
' strings will unlock your sheet or workbook.
' 
' Bypassing Protection
' 
' In many versions of XL, bypassing protection is as easy as selecting the entire
' worksheet, copying it and pasting it to a new worksheet. If you have a lot of
' links between sheets, it can be difficult to substitute the new sheet, but you
' can see what's going on at least.
' 
' Add-ins and macros
' 
' There have been macros published (mostly derived from one that I first saw
' published by Bob McCormick) for years in the newsgroups. There are some add-ins
' that will remove passwords - search the Google newsgroup archives to find them.
' Einar St√•le Huse has written one of the most popular add-ins - password.xla.
' 
' The AllInternalPasswords Macro
' 
' This macro, for which the true origin is lost in antiquity, will unlock all the
' internal passwords in your workbook. It will report which password strings
' worked (so that if you have other workbooks by the same author, you can try it
' on them), but it will NOT report the original password (it can't - it's never
' stored - only the hash is saved in the file). I first saw it in a post by Bob
' McCormick. Norman Harker did an outstanding job in modifying it for workbook as
' well as worksheet protection. I mostly cleaned it up and made it a bit more
' efficient.
' 
' It shouldn't take more than a few seconds (certainly less than a minute) to
' find each password if you have a relatively up to date computer.
' 
' Working passwords will be returned in the form
' 
'     AAABABBABABX where the first 11 characters will be As or Bs and the X
'     represents a character from ASCII 32 (" " or space) to ASCII 126 ("~", or
'     tilde). While the sheet or workbook will automatically be unprotected, the
'     macro suggests you write this code down, not only for future use, but,
'     people being creatures of habit, it may work on another sheet/workbook by
'     the same author. Again, since it's not returning the original password,
'     it's unlikely to be useful in breaking file or VBA project passwords.
' 
' You can download the workbook allinternalpasswords.xls if you don't want to cut
' and paste the macro below. The workbook is hidden, and has an attached toolbar
' with a button to start the macro. Activate the workbook you want to unlock and
'     click the button. The code is unlocked so you may examine and modify it as
'     needed.
' 
' DISCLAIMER: Please note that breaking password protection MAY violate laws or
' regulations in your jurisdiction. In the United States (currently) it is
' certainly OK to break password protection on sheets that you developed for your
' personal use, or for which you have permission from the author or owner. It's
' probably OK if you own the workbook, even if it was written by someone else.
' But neither Norman nor I are intellectual property lawyers in ANY jurisdiction,
' so, if in doubt, ask the original author, and if you can't ask - don't use it!
